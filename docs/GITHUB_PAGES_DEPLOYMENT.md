# Deploying to GitHub Pages

This document explains how to deploy the website using GitHub Pages from the GitHub website interface.

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Go to the GitHub Repository**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to: https://github.com/Hrithikjha07/theunstuckgrowth

2. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in the top menu bar of your repository
   - This will take you to the repository settings page

3. **Go to Pages Settings**
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
   - This will take you to the GitHub Pages settings

4. **Configure Source**
   - Under "Source", select the "Deploy from a branch" option
   - In the "Branch" dropdown, select "main"
   - Make sure the folder is set to "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

5. **Wait for Deployment**
   - GitHub will now start building and deploying your site
   - This process may take a few minutes

6. **Check Deployment Status**
   - You can check the deployment status by:
     - Refreshing the Pages settings page
     - Looking at the "Actions" tab in your repository

7. **View Your Site**
   - Once deployed, GitHub will show a "Your site is live at" message with a link
   - The site will be available at: https://hrithikjha07.github.io/theunstuckgrowth
   - If you've set up a custom domain in your CNAME file, it will be available at that domain once DNS propagates

## Manual Deployment via GitHub Actions

If you want to manually trigger a deployment:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Click on the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click on "Run workflow" 
4. Select the "main" branch
5. Click "Run workflow"

This will manually trigger the GitHub Pages deployment process.

## Troubleshooting

If your deployment fails or doesn't reflect the latest changes:

1. Check the Actions tab to see if there are any workflow errors
2. Verify that your repository has the correct structure for GitHub Pages
3. Make sure your CNAME file contains the correct domain if you're using a custom domain
4. Try running the deployment workflow manually
5. Clear your browser cache when checking the deployed site
