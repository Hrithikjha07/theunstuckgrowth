In our first session, it was super helpful to get your breakdown of how to handle various types of conversations and situations with senior leaderships and stakeholders. I have already applied those tips in my current interactions with senior figures in the organization. Our second session was also beneficial in understanding how to captivate stakeholders, especially when pitching initiatives or asking for support from other teams. Overall, your mentorship has been very helpful and I look forward to more of your insights and knowledge.</p>

Consulting is completely new to me, and I was looking for someone who could break things down and guide me through the casing process and you've done that so well. The way you've structured the mentoring sessions, combined with your personal experience and insights, has made a huge difference for me. Almost everything we've covered, from frameworks to the strategic angles you brought into each case was new to me, and it really opened up my thinking. The homework assignments helped keep the momentum going and gave me space to apply what I'd learned during our sessions. I especially appreciate the way you brainstormed during our sessions and it gave me perspectives I wouldn't have come up with on my own.</p>

I'm going to start working on the "Why" as you suggested. I really appreciate how you framed it, and I can see how getting that clarity will help shape everything else we build from here. Looking forward to staying in touch and sharing updates soon.</p>

                                <p class="review-text">I'm really glad I got the chance to work with you. Consulting is completely new to me, and I was looking for someone who could break things down and guide me through the casing process and you've done that so well. The way you've structured the mentoring sessions, combined with your personal experience and insights, has made a huge difference for me. Almost everything we've covered, from frameworks to the strategic angles you brought into each case was new to me, and it really opened up my thinking. The homework assignments helped keep the momentum going and gave me space to apply what I'd learned during our sessions.</p>

                                <p class="review-text">It's been wonderful getting your insight and perspective. In our first session, it was super helpful to get your breakdown of how to handle various types of conversations and situations with senior leaderships and stakeholders. I have already applied those tips in my current interactions with senior figures in the organization. Our second session was also beneficial in understanding how to captivate stakeholders, especially when pitching initiatives or asking for support from other teams.</p>

                                <p class="review-text">After struggling with product case interviews for months, Swati's structured approach completely transformed how I prepared. She provided frameworks that were both comprehensive and easy to apply, focusing on the key elements that interviewers actually care about. Within three sessions, my confidence skyrocketed, and I was able to articulate my product thinking clearly and persuasively. The result? I just accepted an offer from my dream FAANG company!</p>

Swati helped me cut through the noise and focus on what truly mattered for our early-stage startup. Her framework for validating assumptions and her guidance on user research methodology completely changed our approach. Within two months of implementing her recommendations, we saw a 40% increase in user engagement and secured our first enterprise client.</p>
