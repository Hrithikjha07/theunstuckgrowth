# Fix for DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN Error

The error you're seeing indicates that the DNS for `theunstuckgrowth.com` is not resolving correctly. Here's how to fix it:

## 1. Verify Domain Registration
Make sure your domain is properly registered and active.

## 2. Set Up Correct DNS Records

### For GitHub Pages:
Add these A records at your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

Repeat for these IP addresses:
- 185.199.109.153
- 185.199.110.153
- 185.199.111.153

Add this CNAME record:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: hrithikjha07.github.io
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

### For Netlify (Alternative):
If using Netlify, follow their DNS instructions instead:
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to your site â†’ Domain settings
2. Add custom domain
3. Follow their guided DNS setup

## 3. Wait for DNS Propagation
DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to propagate globally.

## 4. Temporary Solution
While waiting, use the direct GitHub Pages URL:
- https://hrithikjha07.github.io/theunstuckgrowth/

Or deploy to Netlify for an immediate working site.
