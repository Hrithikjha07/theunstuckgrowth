# Fix for Git Deployment Error (Exit Code 128)

The error `The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128` typically indicates an authentication or repository access issue during deployment. Here's how to fix it:

## Solution 1: Fix GitHub Authentication

1. Verify the GitHub Actions workflow has proper permissions:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" → "Actions" → "General"
   - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
   - Save changes

2. Check for workflow conflicts:
   - Go to "Settings" → "Pages"
   - Ensure only one deployment method is selected (GitHub Actions)
   - Remove any redundant workflows by deleting extra workflow files

## Solution 2: Use GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Create a new Personal Access Token (PAT):
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token (classic)
   - Give it a name like "TheUnstuckGrowth Deployment"
   - Set expiration as needed
   - Select these scopes: `repo`, `workflow`
   - Generate token and copy it

2. Add the token to your repository:
   - Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `DEPLOY_TOKEN`
   - Value: [paste your token]
   - Click "Add secret"

3. Update your workflow file to use this token:

```yml
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```

## Solution 3: Use a Simpler Deployment Approach

If you continue having issues with GitHub Actions, try the simplified approach:

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose "main" branch and "/" (root) folder
4. Click "Save"

This uses GitHub's default deployment process without custom workflows.

## Solution 4: Deploy to Netlify Instead

For a guaranteed working deployment:

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to GitHub and select your repository
4. Deploy with default settings
5. Your site will be live in minutes with a Netlify subdomain
