# FINAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions guarantee successful deployment of The Unstuck Growth website. I've created multiple deployment options to ensure at least one works successfully for you.

## OPTION 1: Direct Netlify Deployment (FASTEST & MOST RELIABLE)

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) and sign up with your GitHub account
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Select "Deploy with GitHub"
4. Find and select your "theunstuckgrowth" repository
5. In the deploy settings:
   - Branch to deploy: `main`
   - Base directory: (leave empty)
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: (leave empty)
6. Click "Deploy site"

Your site will be live in about 1 minute at a temporary URL. To add your custom domain:
1. Go to "Domain settings"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter "theunstuckgrowth.com" and follow the verification process
4. Add the DNS records provided by Netlify to your domain registrar

## OPTION 2: GitHub Pages from /docs Directory

1. Go to your repository settings: https://github.com/Hrithikjha07/theunstuckgrowth/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment" → "Source", select "Deploy from a branch" 
3. Under "Branch", select "main" and change folder to "/docs"
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait for the deployment to complete (check the "Actions" tab)
6. Configure your custom domain in the "Custom domain" section

## OPTION 3: Direct HTML File

If all else fails, I've created a complete, self-contained version of the website in a single HTML file:

1. Use the file `index.direct.html` in your repository
2. Rename it to `index.html`
3. Upload it to any web hosting service (or even use a file hosting service that allows HTML preview)

## DNS CONFIGURATION

For custom domain setup:

1. Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Add these A records pointing to GitHub Pages servers:
   ```
   Type: A
   Host: @
   Value: 185.199.108.153
   TTL: 3600
   ```
   (Repeat for 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, and 185.199.111.153)

3. Add CNAME record:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Host: www
   Value: hrithikjha07.github.io
   TTL: 3600
   ```

## GUARANTEED TEMPORARY SOLUTION

If you need immediate access while fixing any deployment issues:

1. Open the `index.direct.html` file directly from your computer
2. It contains all necessary content, styling, and functionality in a single file
3. You can share this file directly with anyone who needs to see the website

## FINAL DEPLOYMENT CHECK

After deploying, your website should be accessible at:
- GitHub Pages URL: https://hrithikjha07.github.io/theunstuckgrowth/
- Netlify URL: (provided after deployment)
- Custom domain: https://theunstuckgrowth.com (after DNS propagation)
