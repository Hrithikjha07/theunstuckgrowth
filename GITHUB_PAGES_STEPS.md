# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

Follow these exact steps to deploy your website on GitHub Pages like your previous version:

## Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
4. Under "Build and deployment" section:
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
5. Click "Save"

## Step 2: Enable the GitHub Pages Workflow

The workflow file has already been updated in your repository. GitHub will automatically detect and use the workflow file at `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

## Step 3: Wait for Deployment

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow run in progress
3. Wait for it to complete (usually takes 1-2 minutes)

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

After the workflow completes:
1. Go back to the "Pages" settings
2. You should see a message saying "Your site is live at https://hrithikjha07.github.io/theunstuckgrowth/"
3. Click on the URL to verify your site is deployed correctly

## Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use your custom domain:
1. In the "Pages" settings, under "Custom domain", enter your domain name
2. Click "Save"
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions to point your domain to GitHub Pages

## Troubleshooting JotForm Issues

If you still see JotForm being blocked after deployment:

1. Try using a different JotForm embed code:
   - Go to your JotForm
   - Click "Publish" > "Embed" > "iframe"
   - Copy the new iframe code
   - Replace the existing iframe code in your website

2. Alternatively, you can use the Netlify deployment with the updated configuration
   - The netlify.toml file has been updated to allow JotForm content
   - Deploy to Netlify using the instructions in FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
