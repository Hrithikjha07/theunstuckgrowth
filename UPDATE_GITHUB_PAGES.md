# How to Update GitHub Pages with Your Local Version

I've created a complete mirror of your local files in the `/docs` folder and pushed it to GitHub. Follow these steps to make GitHub Pages use your local version:

## Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages to Use the /docs Folder

1. Go to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/Hrithikjha07/theunstuckgrowth)
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Build and deployment" → "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. In the "Branch" dropdown, select "main"
6. In the folder dropdown, select "/docs"
7. Click "Save"

## Step 2: Wait for Deployment

1. The deployment will start automatically
2. You can check the status in the "Actions" tab of your repository
3. It usually takes 1-2 minutes to complete

## Step 3: Verify the Deployment

Your site will be available at:
- https://hrithikjha07.github.io/theunstuckgrowth/

## What Has Been Done

1. ✅ Created a complete copy of all your local files in the `/docs` folder
2. ✅ Pushed these files to your GitHub repository
3. ✅ Added new GitHub Actions workflow files that are more reliable

## For Future Updates

When you make changes locally and want to update the deployed version:

1. Copy your changes to the `/docs` folder:
   ```
   robocopy . docs /MIR /XD .git .github node_modules docs
   ```

2. Commit and push the changes:
   ```
   git add docs
   git commit -m "Update docs folder with latest changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Need to Make Quick Changes Directly?

You can also edit files directly on GitHub by:
1. Navigating to the file in the `/docs` folder
2. Clicking the pencil icon to edit
3. Committing your changes
